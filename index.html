      <h2>Instructions for MineSweeper
      </h2>
      <h2>Quick Start:
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines (bombs), others don't. If you click on a square containing a bomb, you lose. If you manage to click all the squares (without clicking on any bombs) you win.</li>
        <li>Clicking a square which doesn't have a bomb reveals the number of neighbouring squares containing bombs. Use this information plus some guess work to avoid the bombs.</li>
        <li>To open a square, point at the square and click on it. To mark a square you think is a bomb, point and right-click (or hover with the mouse and press Space).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Detailed Instructions:
      </h2>
      <li>A squares "neighbours" are the squares adjacent above, below, left, right, and all 4 diagonals. Squares on the sides of the board or in a corner have fewer neighbors. The board does not wrap around the edges.</li>
      <li>To remove a bomb marker from a square, point at it and right-click again.</li>
      <li>If you mark a bomb incorrectly, you will have to correct the mistake before you can win. Incorrect bomb marking doesn't kill you, but it can lead to mistakes which do.</li>
      <li>You don't have to mark all the bombs to win; you just need to open all non-bomb squares.</li>
      <li>Right-clicking twice will give you a question mark symbol which can be useful if you are unsure about a square</li>
